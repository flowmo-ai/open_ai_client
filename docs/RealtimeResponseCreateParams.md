# OpenAIClient::RealtimeResponseCreateParams

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**modalities** | **Array&lt;String&gt;** | The set of modalities the model can respond with. To disable audio, set this to [\&quot;text\&quot;].  | [optional] 
**instructions** | **String** | The default system instructions (i.e. system message) prepended to model  calls. This field allows the client to guide the model on desired  responses. The model can be instructed on response content and format,  (e.g. \&quot;be extremely succinct\&quot;, \&quot;act friendly\&quot;, \&quot;here are examples of good  responses\&quot;) and on audio behavior (e.g. \&quot;talk quickly\&quot;, \&quot;inject emotion  into your voice\&quot;, \&quot;laugh frequently\&quot;). The instructions are not guaranteed  to be followed by the model, but they provide guidance to the model on the  desired behavior.  Note that the server sets default instructions which will be used if this  field is not set and are visible in the &#x60;session.created&#x60; event at the  start of the session.  | [optional] 
**voice** | **String** | The voice the model uses to respond. Voice cannot be changed during the  session once the model has responded with audio at least once. Current  voice options are &#x60;alloy&#x60;, &#x60;ash&#x60;, &#x60;ballad&#x60;, &#x60;coral&#x60;, &#x60;echo&#x60; &#x60;sage&#x60;,  &#x60;shimmer&#x60; and &#x60;verse&#x60;.  | [optional] 
**output_audio_format** | **String** | The format of output audio. Options are &#x60;pcm16&#x60;, &#x60;g711_ulaw&#x60;, or &#x60;g711_alaw&#x60;.  | [optional] 
**tools** | [**Array&lt;RealtimeResponseCreateParamsTools&gt;**](RealtimeResponseCreateParamsTools.md) | Tools (functions) available to the model. | [optional] 
**tool_choice** | **String** | How the model chooses tools. Options are &#x60;auto&#x60;, &#x60;none&#x60;, &#x60;required&#x60;, or  specify a function, like &#x60;{\&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;function\&quot;, \&quot;function\&quot;: {\&quot;name\&quot;: \&quot;my_function\&quot;}}&#x60;.  | [optional] 
**temperature** | [**BigDecimal**](BigDecimal.md) | Sampling temperature for the model, limited to [0.6, 1.2]. Defaults to 0.8.  | [optional] 
**max_response_output_tokens** | [**OneOfRealtimeResponseCreateParamsMaxResponseOutputTokens**](OneOfRealtimeResponseCreateParamsMaxResponseOutputTokens.md) | Maximum number of output tokens for a single assistant response, inclusive of tool calls. Provide an integer between 1 and 4096 to limit output tokens, or &#x60;inf&#x60; for the maximum available tokens for a given model. Defaults to &#x60;inf&#x60;.  | [optional] 
**conversation** | [**OneOfRealtimeResponseCreateParamsConversation**](OneOfRealtimeResponseCreateParamsConversation.md) | Controls which conversation the response is added to. Currently supports &#x60;auto&#x60; and &#x60;none&#x60;, with &#x60;auto&#x60; as the default value. The &#x60;auto&#x60; value means that the contents of the response will be added to the default conversation. Set this to &#x60;none&#x60; to create an out-of-band response which  will not add items to default conversation.  | [optional] 
**metadata** | [**Metadata**](Metadata.md) |  | [optional] 
**input** | [**Array&lt;RealtimeConversationItem&gt;**](RealtimeConversationItem.md) | Input items to include in the prompt for the model. Creates a new context for this response, without including the default conversation. Can include references to items from the default conversation.  | [optional]
